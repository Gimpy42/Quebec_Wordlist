A useful wordlist made from French Canadian leaked passwords!


<b>GOAL</b>
---
At @w0lfd3n, we are a group of professionnal and amateurs hackers from Quebec, Canada. This project was born from our desire to create the Canadian French equivalent of the "rockyou" wordlist, to be used with Hashcat or John The Ripper. The wordlist is a mixture of public available repos and leaked passwords related to French Canadian domains.

<b>THANKS</b>
