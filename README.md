A useful wordlist made from French Canadian leaked passwords!

---
## GOAL

At @w0lfd3n, we are a group of professionnal and amateurs infosec enthusiats from Quebec, Canada. 
This project was born from our desire to create the French Canadian equivalent of the "rockyou" wordlist, to be used with Hashcat or John The Ripper. 

The wordlist is a mixture of public available repos and leaked passwords related to French Canadian domains ( please see the setion methodology for more infos).

---
## METHODOLOGY


Our wordlist is based on multiple domains coming from Quebec private sector, public institutions, telecoms and more. 

By enumerating relevant domains and passwords, while eliminating duplicates, we obtained the list quebec.txt.

We plan to update regurarly the wordlist, as we find more proper data to add.
