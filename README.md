A useful wordlist made from French Canadian leaked passwords!


## GOAL
---
At @w0lfd3n, we are a group of professionnal and amateurs hackers from Quebec, Canada. This project was born from our desire to create the French Canadian equivalent of the "rockyou" wordlist, to be used with Hashcat or John The Ripper. The wordlist is a mixture of public available repos and leaked passwords related to French Canadian domains ( please see #methodology for more infos).

## THANKS
---
Shoutout at @hmaverickadams for his very useful breachparse tool, which was used in the making of this list ->  ([breachparse tool](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse))

## METHODOLOGY

Our wordlist is based on multiple domains coming from Quebec private companies, public institutions, telecoms and more.

By enumerating relevant domains and passwords, while eliminating duplicates, we obtained the list quebec.txt.
